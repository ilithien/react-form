# React form

It's known that working with forms in React could be a little verbose. I've created a simple and easy usable React library with hooks. In order to use this form library, custom controls must be used but I haven't added any CSS to make it flexible and easy to bring your own css and override classes you might need.

## Form Controls

- Input
- Select

### Usage

This library is not ready to be used yet, but if you want to test it out you can clone the repository and start a simple demo with `yarn start`
